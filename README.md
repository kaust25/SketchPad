# SketchPad

SketchPad is a web-based application built using Phaser, MongoDB Atlas, and NoSQL database technology as part of my Web-Lab Capstone Project. It allows users to collaboratively draw and share sketches in real-time. The application is deployed and accessible at [https://pianco25.github.io/SketchPad/](https://pianco25.github.io/SketchPad/).

## Functionality

- SketchPad utilizes Phaser, a powerful HTML5 game framework, to provide an interactive drawing canvas with support for various drawing tools.
- The application integrates with MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based NoSQL database, for storing and retrieving sketch data.
- Users can create or join a game session by entering a unique game ID. The application handles the authentication and assignment of host and visitor roles.
- The drawing strokes made by the participants are stored in the MongoDB database and synchronized in real-time, allowing all participants to see and collaborate on the sketch.

## Tech Stack

- MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-based NoSQL database for storing sketch data.
- Phaser: HTML5 game framework used to develop the interactive drawing canvas.
- JavaScript: Programming language used for implementing the application logic.
- HTML and CSS: Markup and styling languages for building the user interface.
- GitHub Pages: Hosting platform used to deploy the SketchPad application.
